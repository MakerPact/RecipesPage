# Recipes

The recipes I like to use. Now I won't loose them with my phone.

**A bit of a glossery:**

When I say salt, I mean plain old table salt. Not pink, not kosher..

When I say olive oil I mean extra light taste olive oil. Typically Burtolli brand.

When I say rice, I mean Basmati rice. This will make the cooking temps & times work out.

When I say beans. I mean Pink beans. Like Pinto beans, but better.

Brining beans. Yes I brine them. 2 Qt water, 2 tbl salt, 2 cups dry PINK beans, overnight. (Get the quality brand, it does make a difference.)

Chicken? Chicken would be boneless skinless thigh meat. Sometimes bone in. Tasteless & tough breast meat? Only if specified.

Mayo? This would be my own, made with olive oil. If specified, possibly Best Foods Mayo.

Dutch oven. Mine is cast iron, 6 qt. It's actually from Martha Stuart. Gift from the wife, many years ago.

Stand mixer? KitchenAid Artisan. Bought by a friend about 30 some years ago as a rebuilt machine. Still running.

Pork chop? 3/4" thick bone in.

Spice, spice for frying chicken, or prawns. (marionkay.com Chicken seasoning 99-X) <- This is the bomb!

Chicken Italian sausage. Isernoio's Hot Italian chicken sausage. Comes in 1 lb packs. All the flavor without the pork fat.
