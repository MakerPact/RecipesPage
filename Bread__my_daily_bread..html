    <h1>Grab stand mixer bowl, add..</h1>
    <pre>4 cups flour
1 tsp salt
2 tsp yeast

Whisk this all together.

Add 2 cups warm to touch water.

Put in mixer, starting out dead slow as to not spray stuff all over, with dough hook, start mixing. When dough comes together, bring it up to full power and beat it around for a while.

Cover, let it raise 'till about the top of the mixing bowl.

Start the mixer again. But this time, slowly add a second tsp of salt as it mixes.

Cover, let it rise again to about the top of the bowl.

Scrape dough out onto a well floured sheet of parchment paper. Kneed by hand. Bring to a ball.

Cover, let it rise again. (Sheesh, it's like the south!)

When it's risen, about double in size, pop your dutch oven into a cold oven. Bring temp to 450 F. I did say this bakes in a dutch oven didn't I?

Once the oven comes up to 450 F. Bring out the Dutch oven, uncover and gently lower your bread ball into it using the parchment paper.

Lid back on, bake at 450 F covered for 30 min.

Lid off, continue baking for another 20 min.

Pull out the Dutch oven, lift out the loaf using the parchment paper. Place on cooling rack.

Slice when completely cool. Store in Dutch oven once cooled. Or freeze.. up to you.</pre>
