Bake 325 in two 8" round pans. 30..40 minutes. Wait 'till come off the edges and toothpick comes out clean.

Well I picked the apples. Made the Apple sauce. Baked the cake, created the icing and frosted the cake with it. And it turned out...

Kinda' bland. No way t tell that there was any apples in there. Not bad.. Just boring.</pre>
