    <h1>Spiced up "British beans n toast"</h1>
    <pre>Big Julie Favorite!

In Med. Large frying pan..
Drizzle in a coating of olive oil.
1 Adell chicken sausage chopped up
2 Hot dogs chopped up
1/2 onion chopped up
Couple shakes of Cajun seasoning.

Fry all of this 'till the onions are starting to get clear. Adding oil as needed. Near the end of frying, add a smallish drizzle of Tapatio sauce for a touch of heat.

Once everything is fried up..
Add 1 can of Heinz "Beanz".
Fry up everything together 'till the beans are fully heated.

Taste and carefully add salt to move taste away from bland.

Serve in a bowl over a slice of toast.

Julie went wild for this. I mean like me with pie. Wanted me to make up another batch so she could have more.</pre>
