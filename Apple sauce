Apple sauce

Take about a grocery bag of home picked somewhat tart apples.
Fill 4 qt. sauce pan to overflowing with apple chunks.
About 1/2 cup water to prime the boiling.
Cook on low. 
Check and stir every 20 minutes or so 'till mostly done.

Then add..
1 cup brown sugar.
1/2 tsp nutmeg.
1/2 tsp cinnamon.
NO CLOVES - well maybe the tinniest pinch.
2 tsp vanilla.

Cook 'till desired doneness.

Turned out delicious!
