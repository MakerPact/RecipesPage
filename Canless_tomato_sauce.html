    <h1>Canless tomato sauce</h1>
    <pre>This is the sauce base for the #0 spaghetti sauce.

Grind up into liquid:
5..6 lbs tomatoes.
1 1/2 tsp white wine vinegar.
Most of med bulb garlic
1 tbl olive oil. 


Quarter the tomatoes cut away all the stem material. Then eighth them. Blend the tomatoes & garlic completely and pour the resulting liquid in a large 9qt sauce pan (Dutch oven?). 

Add the olive oil and vinegar then set the liquid to boil. Stirring now and again to keep it from burning on the bottom.

You have to boil off all the excess water. Until you do, the sauce will taste like liquid lawn mower clippings. Not a taste suited to humans.

After a LONG time the sauce will stop boiling and begin to make plopping sounds. Like volcanic mud pots.

At this point add in the rest of your flavors. Sugar, salt, chili powder, cayenne pepper. Mix it all in and adjust for taste. I typically run it a little on the sweet side.

The spice pack:
1 tsp salt.
4 tbl sugar.
4 tsp chili powder.
1/4..1/2 tsp cayenne pepper.
6 fresh basil leafs.

Boil the combined sauce for a while to get everything melded together. Maybe 20 minutes?

NOTE : I like 1/2 tsp cayenne. But, maybe roll it back to 1/4. Let end user adjust up if appropriate.

Good luck!</pre>
