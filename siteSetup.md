# Setting Up Your Recipe Blog

Hello! This guide will walk you through setting up your new, easy-to-use recipe blog. Just a few simple steps and you'll be ready to go!

## 1. Fork this Repository

First, you'll need to create your own copy of this repository.

*   Click the **Fork** button at the top-right of this page.
*   This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

## 2. Enable GitHub Pages

Next, you'll need to tell GitHub to publish the website.

*   In your newly forked repository, go to the **Settings** tab.
*   In the left-hand menu, click on **Pages**.
*   Under **Source**, select the `gh-pages` branch from the dropdown menu and click **Save**. If the `gh-pages` branch doesn't exist yet, don't worry! It will be created automatically the first time you make a change to the recipes.
*   GitHub will then display the URL where your site will be published. It might take a few minutes for the site to go live.

That's it! Your recipe blog is now set up and ready to go. You can now move on to the fun part: adding your recipes! See the `addApage.md` file for instructions on how to do that.
