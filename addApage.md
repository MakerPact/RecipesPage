# How to Add a New Recipe

Hello! I'm so excited for you to share your wonderful recipes with the world. This guide will show you how to add a new recipe to your blog. It's as easy as adding a new text file!

## 1. Open the `recipes` folder

*   From the main page of your repository, you'll see a list of files and folders. Click on the `recipes` folder. This is where all your delicious recipes live.

## 2. Add a new file

*   At the top-right of the file list, click the **Add file** button and choose **Create new file**.

## 3. Name your recipe file

*   In the box that says "Name your file...", type in the name of your recipe. It's best to keep it simple, like `My Favorite Chili.txt` or `Grandmas Cookies.md`. You can use `.txt` or `.md` at the end, whichever you prefer!

## 4. Write your recipe

*   In the large text box below the file name, you can now write your recipe!
*   **Important:** The very first line of the file will be the title of your recipe page. So, make sure the first thing you type is the name of your dish, like `Grandma's Famous Apple Pie`.
*   After the title, you can write the rest of your recipe. You can add ingredients, instructions, and any notes you like. Just type it out like you would in a normal text editor.

## 5. Save the file

*   Once you're happy with your recipe, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the green **Commit new file** button. You don't need to change any of the text in the boxes, just click the button.

## That's it! You're done!

Your new recipe has been added to the blog. It might take a few minutes for the website to update, so be patient. You can check your site at the URL you got from the setup steps to see your new recipe live.

You're doing great! Keep sharing your amazing recipes.
